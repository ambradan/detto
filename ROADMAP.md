## What will NOT happen

### No monetization
Detto will not become a paid product.
No subscriptions, no premium tiers, no ads.

### No user accounts
No login, no profiles, no server-side storage.
Privacy by architecture.

### No gamification
No streaks, no achievements, no engagement metrics.
Tools should not demand attention.

### No mobile app store release
Web-first. Works on mobile browsers.
No App Store / Play Store gatekeeping.

## How to influence the roadmap

Open an issue with:
- A specific use case or problem
- A concrete suggestion
- Willingness to test or contribute

Vague feature requests will be noted but not prioritized.

## Versioning

Detto does not follow semantic versioning.
Changes are continuous. Breaking changes are announced in commits.

There is no "stable release" — the live app is always current.
