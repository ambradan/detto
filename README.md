# Detto

A minimal web app for the **voice → text → voice** flow,
designed with a strong focus on accessibility, inclusion,
and reduced cognitive effort.

Detto is not a product and not a structured project.
It is a small design experiment, built in a few hours,
to explore a more careful and respectful use of AI.

## What it does

- Transcribes audio into text
- Allows full manual editing of the generated text
- Converts text back into audio
- Works with long pauses and discontinuous speech
- Avoids inventing content when something is unclear

## Why it exists

Detto is designed with people in mind who experience
**objective communication difficulties**, temporary or permanent:
unstable or weak voice, long pauses, fatigue,
non-intentional sounds, noisy or shared environments.

The goal is not to do more.
The goal is to **make fewer mistakes**.
