# Detto

**Dalla voce al testo – e di nuovo alla voce.**

A minimal web app for transforming voice messages into clean, editable text,
with full manual control and text-to-speech output.

Designed for people who experience communication difficulties:
weak or unstable voice, long pauses, fatigue, background noise,
or reliance on medical devices like ventilators.

## What it does

- Records audio with noise suppression and auto gain
- Transcribes and cleans text (removes non-verbal sounds, hesitations, device noise)
- Allows full manual editing before use
- Converts final text back to audio
- Supports long pauses without auto-stopping
- Never invents content — prefers omission over fabrication

---

## Design principles

- User controls the final output, always
- Silence and pauses are normal, not errors
- Incomplete output is better than incorrect output
- AI assists, it does not author
- Preserve the user's voice and tone, do not flatten personality
