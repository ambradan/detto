## Contribution guidelines

### Keep it minimal
Detto is intentionally simple.
Features that add complexity need strong justification.

### Accessibility first
Changes must not break accessibility.
Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### No tracking
Do not add analytics, telemetry, or user tracking.
Privacy is non-negotiable.

### Italian UI, English docs
- User-facing text: Italian
- Documentation: English
- Code comments: English

### Test before submitting
- Test on mobile and desktop
- Test with slow/unstable network
- Test with edge cases (long pauses, low volume, noise)

## What we don't need

### Feature bloat
"What if it also did X" is usually a no.
Detto does one thing. Additions must serve that thing.

### Platform expansion
No Electron app, no native iOS/Android.
Web-first is intentional.

### Enterprise features
No multi-user, no admin panel, no SSO.
This is a personal tool.

### AI hype
No "powered by AI" badges, no marketing language.
The AI is invisible infrastructure, not a selling point.
