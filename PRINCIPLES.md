# Design Principles

Detto is built on a small set of non-negotiable principles.

---

## 1. User controls the output

The user always has final say.

- Output is editable before use
- Nothing is auto-sent or auto-committed
- Every action requires explicit intent

---

## 2. Silence is not an error

Long pauses, slow speech, and silence are expected behaviors.

- Recording does not auto-stop on silence
- Pauses are treated as breathing time, not timeouts
- Turn-taking is protected, not rushed

---

## 3. Incomplete is better than incorrect

When in doubt, omit.

- Unclear words are marked with "[…]" or silently omitted
- No content is invented to fill gaps
- Confidence is never faked

---

## 4. AI assists, it does not author

The AI is a tool, not a voice.

- Cleaning and formatting only
- No additions, no creative liberties
- The message belongs to the user

---

## 5. Preserve identity

The user's voice, tone, and personality matter.

- "Mio stile" preserves irony, humor, personal expressions
- Style is not flattened into corporate neutral
- The output should sound like the user, not like a template

---

## 6. Reduce effort, not control

Fewer steps, but never at the cost of agency.

- One-tap actions where possible
- Auto-play to reduce clicks
- But always with undo, edit, retry available

---

## 7. Transparency over polish

Honest output is more valuable than smooth output.

- "Bozza" label when quality is uncertain
- Warnings for background noise, low volume
- Limits are documented, not hidden

---

## 8. No blame

The system adapts to the user, not the other way around.

- No "speak more clearly" messages
- No "try again" without alternatives
- Errors are system failures, not user failures

---
