# Design principles

Detto follows a few simple principles:

- Do not invent missing content
- Treat silence and long pauses as normal behavior
- Reduce unnecessary steps and forced decisions
- Always leave final control to the user
- Prefer incomplete output over incorrect output
- Do not pretend certainty when there is none

AI is used as a tool, not as an author.
